Indentation
============
- indentation in python is used to define block of code.
- In many other programming language, that use braces({}) to define block of code but in  python we use in to dentation block of code.

- we can define indentation either by using space or tabspace
- to writing same number of space or tabspace is mandatory
- if space is increasing after first statement then will throw compile time error
- if space is 0 then statement consider as outside statement from the fun or loop.
